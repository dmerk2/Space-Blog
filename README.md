## Description


We created a blog post called Spaced Out. Spaced out is a collection of thoughts created by users who use Marijuana. Right now the page is still being devoleped, stay tuned for upgrades to the project. We have already created a backend for the website and we have a cool design for the front end. We would like to incorperate the following features in the not to distant future.

* We would like users to be able  to create an account. 
* We would like usesrs to post blog posts.
* We would  like if users can also edit and delete their own posts.  
* allow them to comment on posts from other users.
* create our front end with Handlebars.js
